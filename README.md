# yelp-camp
A Node.js project I've worked on following the instructor along the way. The app is like Yelp for campgrounds.

To run this app:
On your computer, run mongod (mongo daemon) however you have it set up. Make sure that you have mongodb version 3.6.2 or higher.

Then

npm install

node app.js
